# The Allergen Filter
The Allergen Filter provides exactly what users with dietary requirements need. Built on a framework of a Django search engine and SQLite database, it allows users with dietary requirements to find out exactly what food they can or can't eat. The front end development uses bootstrap 3 and javascript with display built in through html and css. Some of the features of the site include
- A barcode or text search for easy input
- Visual friendly icons and food ingredient descriptions
- A database compiled from different major supermarkets
